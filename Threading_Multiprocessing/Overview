Threading
- A new thread is spawned within the existing process
- Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
- Memory is shared between threads
- Mutexes often needed to control access to shared data
- One Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for all threads



Multiprocessing
- A new process is started independent from the first process
- Starting a new process is slower than starting a new thread
- Memory is not shared between processes
- Mutexes not needed to control access to shared data
- One GIL for each process
